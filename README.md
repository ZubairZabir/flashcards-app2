# Flashcard App - Web Development Project

### Submitted by: Zubair Zabir

## Overview

This project is a dynamic flashcard app built with React. The app allows users to study using digital flashcards, where they can flip through cards, guess answers, and check if their responses are correct. It includes functionality to navigate between cards, shuffle cards, and track the user's streak of correct answers.

## Time Spent

**5 hours** spent in total on the project.

## Required Features

The following required functionality has been completed:

- [x] Users can enter their guess for each flashcard and receive feedback on whether their guess was correct or incorrect.
- [x] Users can **navigate** between flashcards using **Next** and **Back** buttons.
- [x] The app provides **visual feedback** on correct or incorrect answers.
- [x] The app maintains a streak count and tracks the **longest streak** of correct answers.

## Optional Features

The following optional features have been implemented:

- [x] Users can **shuffle** the flashcards to randomize their order.
- [x] The app provides **smooth transitions** and **animations** for better user experience.
- [x] The flashcards have a **responsive design** to adapt to both desktop and mobile devices.
- [x] User answers are compared with slight tolerance (case-insensitive matching).

## Additional Features

- **State management** using React hooks to store and update the current card, user input, and streaks.
- **Dynamic animations** for card flipping and navigation.
- **Hover effects** to provide an interactive user experience.
- **Smooth transitions** between card flips and visual feedback.

## Notes

### Challenges Encountered:

- Ensuring that the **flip animation** worked smoothly across all browsers and devices.
- **Centering the flashcards** perfectly on larger screens while maintaining the responsiveness of the design.
- Adjusting the **layout for mobile devices** to ensure that the flashcards were still readable and user-friendly on smaller screens.
